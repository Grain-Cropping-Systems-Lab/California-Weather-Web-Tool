Weather patterns are highly variable across the state of California. They change from year to year and across locations. For growers, consultants, and agronomists, location-specific weather information is essential for understanding plant growth and water use. It is also important for planning field management activities such as fertilization and irrigation. This tool provides location- and time-specific weather information for sites in the state of California. 

The tool is available now at: http://smallgrains.ucanr.edu/General_Production/weather/

This repository contains the code for the R Shiny App that is the California Weather Web-Tool. While currently only available for California, the underlying data is available for much of the US and the app could easily be adapted to provide information for other regions.
